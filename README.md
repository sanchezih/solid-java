SOLID es un acronimo acu√±ado por Robert C. Martin para definir los cinco principios basicos de la programacion orientada a objetos: Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation y Dependency inversion

## Principios

| Clase Nro. | Tema |S |
|:-:|---|---|
| S |S |   Single Responsibility: Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality.							|
| O |S |	Open Closed: Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification. In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.												|
| L |S |	Liskov Substitution: This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.	|
| I |S |	Interface Segregation: Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.										|
| D |S |	Dependency Inversion: Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.					|
